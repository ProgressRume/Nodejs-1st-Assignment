### Define Monolithic architecture

This is a model that is unified i.e the architecture is self-contained and independent from other applications.
In monolithic architecture, the services and components of the application are in one place. To make a change in this application, the entire stack has to be updated by accessing the code base and building and deploying an updated version of the service-side interface.


### Explain microservices in your own understanding

Unlike monolithic architecture, in microservices, the application is broken down into different  microservices that are encapsulated and changes can be made individually.

### Which of the backend architecture appeals to you and why?

Microservices seems more appealing.
This architecture model seems more futuristic and can work better for companies looking to scale up in future. 

### Is Nodejs a multithreaded language?
Yes

### What does REPL stand for?
